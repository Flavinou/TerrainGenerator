## Terrain Generator

Simple iteration of a Terrain Generator based on Perlin Noise and 
Sebastian Lague's excellent series on Youtube named "Procedural Landmass Generation".

This project aims at reproducing the described behaviour in Godot Engine 4.1
as a hobby project.

The next step would be to control what is generated in the terrain, make some 
areas persist and provide a sandbox for exploration based games.
